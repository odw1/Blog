<h2>Controlling component registration with ConfigureIf</h2>

<p>
	When using Castle Windsor every so often I come across a scenario where I want a subset of the components to be registered differently based on something like a certain Attribute being present or a value in configuration being set. Fortunately Castle Windsor provides functionality to do this via the ConfigureIf method, ConfigureIf executes a provided predicate and can apply different configuration based on the result of evaluating the predicate.
	
	The scenario I'll use to demonstrate this is as follows; for certain pages on our website we need to audit the request.
	
	To perform the auditing we will use an <a href="http://stw.castleproject.org/Windsor.Interceptors.ashx">Interceptor</a>, by using Interceptors we are able to intercept the method invocation both before and after execution, the code for the Interceptor is as follows
</p>

[sourcecode language="csharp"]
    public class AuditInterceptor : IInterceptor
    {
        public void Intercept(IInvocation invocation)
        {
            if (invocation.Method.Name == "OnActionExecuting")
            {
                AuditRequest(invocation);
            }

            invocation.Proceed();
        }

        public void AuditRequest(IInvocation invocation)
        {
            // Audit request details
        }
    }
[/sourcecode]

<p>
	To indicate that requests to a page should be audited we simply create an Attribute and apply it to the Controller that serves the page, as follows
</p>

[sourcecode language="csharp"]
    public class RequiresAuditAttribute : Attribute
    {
        
    }
	
	[RequiresAudit]
    public class AccountController : Controller
    {
        public ActionResult Index()
        {
            return View();
        }

    }
[/sourcecode]

<p>
	Next we get on to the interesting part, during component registration we use the ConfigureIf method to check if a Controller has the RequiresAuditAttribute and if so attach the AuditInterceptor
</p>

[sourcecode language="csharp"]
    public class ControllersInstaller : IWindsorInstaller
    {
        public void Install(IWindsorContainer container, IConfigurationStore store)
        {
            container.Register(AllTypes.FromThisAssembly()
                                   .BasedOn<IController>()
                                   .If(Component.IsInSameNamespaceAs<HomeController>())
                                   .If(t => t.Name.EndsWith("Controller"))
                                   .Configure(c => c.LifestyleTransient())
                                   .ConfigureIf(
                                       c => c.Implementation.IsDefined(typeof (RequiresAuditAttribute), false),
                                       c => c.Interceptors<AuditInterceptor>()));
        }
    }
[/sourcecode]
